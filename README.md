# CS300-Portfolio
Overview

This repository contains selected artifacts from my CS 300 coursework, focusing on the analysis and implementation of data structures and algorithms. The included materials demonstrate my ability to evaluate algorithmic efficiency and develop working software solutions using appropriate data structures.

Reflection

What problem was I solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem addressed in this course was designing and implementing an advising assistance system for ABC University that could efficiently store, organize, and retrieve course information. The system needed to support loading course data from a file, sorting courses alphanumerically, and retrieving detailed course information such as titles and prerequisites. The challenge was determining which data structures were best suited to meet these functional and performance requirements.

How did I approach the problem, and why are data structures important?
I approached the problem by first designing pseudocode and analyzing multiple data structures, including vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Understanding data structures was critical because each structure has different performance characteristics that directly affect runtime, memory usage, and scalability. By evaluating Big O complexity and operational trade-offs, I was able to select the most appropriate structure for the problem before writing any production code.

How did I overcome roadblocks during the projects?
Some challenges included debugging logic errors, managing dynamic memory, and ensuring correct data parsing from files. I overcame these issues by breaking problems into smaller steps, using incremental testing, and revisiting my pseudocode when implementation issues arose. Reviewing algorithm behavior and carefully tracing program execution helped me resolve these challenges effectively.

How has this project expanded my approach to designing software?
This project reinforced the importance of planning before coding. Writing detailed pseudocode, analyzing runtime complexity, and selecting the correct data structure upfront resulted in cleaner and more efficient implementations. I now approach software design with greater emphasis on scalability, performance, and long-term maintainability rather than focusing only on functionality.

How has this work influenced the way I write maintainable and adaptable code?
My work in CS 300 improved how I structure programs using modular design, clear naming conventions, and meaningful comments. I now write code that is easier to read, test, and modify, with clear separation of responsibilities and reusable components. These practices make my programs more adaptable to future changes and easier for others to understand.
